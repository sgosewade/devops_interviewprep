resolve merge conflict in Git

here are a few steps that could reduce the steps needed to resolve merge conflicts in Git.

The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes
After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content
The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command
Git will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge
Git Commands to Resolve Conflicts
1. git log --merge 
The git log --merge command helps to produce the list of commits that are causing the conflict

2. git diff 
The git diff command helps to identify the differences between the states repositories or files

3. git checkout 
The git checkout command is used to undo the changes made to the file, or for changing branches

4. git reset --mixed 
The git reset --mixed command is used to undo changes to the working directory and staging area

5. git merge --abort
The git merge --abort command helps in exiting the merge process and returning back to the state before the merging began

6. git reset
The git reset command is used at the time of merge conflict to reset the conflicted files to their original state

7. Using git mergetool
configure the tool
git config merge.tool meld 
you can solve merge conflicts
git mergetool -t meld


*****git sequnce of creatinf/cloning
mkdir [directory- name]
cd [directory- name]
git config
git init 
git clone [URL]
git add to add new file or modifying an existing folder
git commit -m ""
git push origin remote-branch-name
git pull remote-branch-name to pull latest changes

*****if you add new to git===>>>
git add to add new file or modifying an existing folder
git commit -m ""

*****if you modify existing file from the repo===>>>
git add to add new file or modifying an existing folder
git commit -m ""

*****git commit --amend -m ""
The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. 
It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit.
It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot.

*****git snapshot ===
git log details
A snapshot/commit object is essentially metadata (author, date, message) and a snapshot of the contents of your work tree

*****get last n number of commit details using
 ==>>git log -n
 
*****how will you know if your file/changes is checkedin/pushed or not
==>git log --graph --all --decorate, git status | git diff |git log

search for merge question in git

*****git cherry-pick
Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.
git cherry-pick commitSha

*****i)git stash
This command can be used when we want to save our work without staging or committing the code to our Git repository and want to switch between branches.
ii): git stash -u
This command is used when we want to stash the untracked files.
iii): git stash pop
This command is used when we are back on our branch and want to retrieve the code.

*****git revert [commit id]

The git revert command can be considered as an ‘undo’ command. However, it does not work as the traditional ‘undo’ operation.
It figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content.

git reset SOFT vs HARD
exmaple:: - A - B - C (master)
--soft: uncommit changes, changes are left staged (index). 							git reset --soft B
--mixed (default): uncommit + unstage changes, changes are left in working tree.	git reset --mixed B
--hard: uncommit + unstage + delete changes, nothing left.							git reset --hard B

*****git rebase [base]
Rebase is the process of moving and combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
Rebasing is changing the base of our branch from one commit to another, making it appear as if we’ve created our branch from a different commit.
===>> git rebase master 

*****python files exist program

You have the os.path.exists function:

import os.path
os.path.exists(file_path)
This returns True for both files and directories but you can instead use

os.path.isfile(file_path)
to test if it's a file specifically. It follows symlinks.
*****python sorting without using library func

unix if else for files and directory searching
file="/.config/backup.cfg"
#!/bin/bash
FILE="$1"
 
if [ -f "$FILE" ];
then
   echo "File $FILE exist."
else
   echo "File $FILE does not exist" >&2
fi

python replace can be used in lists or not?
words = 'I like chicken'.split()
replaced = ['turkey' if wd == "chicken" else wd for wd in words]
print(replaced)
Which outputs: ['I', 'like', 'turkey']
