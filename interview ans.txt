weakness:
in situations where there's a deadline to be met or a task which is complex I tend to put all my focus in there and wont budge till it is done and 
in these situations I also tend to make my colleagues also work hard for it. Where i realised that taking breaks in between helps a lot and makes 
you think clearly and you should not sacrifice that sleep which makes your intellectual capacity more clearer and understood everyone works in a 
diffrent way and you should not interfare with thier thinking process
