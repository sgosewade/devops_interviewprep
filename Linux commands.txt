UNIX COMMANDS!!!!

1. free command
The free command is the most simple and easy to use command to check memory usage on linux. 
syntax: free -m

2. /proc/meminfo
to check memory usage is to read the /proc/meminfo file.
syntax: cat /proc/meminfo

3. vmstat
The vmstat command with the s option, lays out the memory usage statistics much like the proc command. Here is an example
$ vmstat -s

4. /proc/cpuinfo
The /proc/cpuinfo file contains details about individual cpu cores.
Output its contents with less or cat.
$ less /proc/cpuinfo

5. lscpu - display information about the CPU architecture
lscpu is a small and quick command that does not need any options. It would simply print the cpu hardware details in a user-friendly format.
$ lscpu

6. Check File System Disk Space Usage
The “df” command displays the information of device name, total blocks, total disk space, used disk space, available disk space and mount points on a file system.
$ df -a -h -m    m===> in mb -h===>in gb 
$ df -hT /$path

7.“du” (Disk Usage) is used to check the information of disk usage of files and directories on a machine.
$du 
$du -h /home/mandeep/test 

							-0, –null : end each output line with NULL
							-a, –all : write count of all files, not just directories
							–apparent-size : print apparent sizes, rather than disk usage.
							-B, –block-size=SIZE : scale sizes to SIZE before printing on console
							-c, –total : produce grand total
							-d, –max-depth=N : print total for directory only if it is N or fewer levels below command line argument
							-h, –human-readable : print sizes in human readable format
							-S, -separate-dirs : for directories, don’t include size of subdirectories
							-s, –summarize : display only total for each directory
							–time : show time of last modification of any file or directory.
							–exclude=PATTERN : exclude files that match PATTERN

8. fdisk
Fdisk is the most commonly used command to check the partitions on a disk.
The fdisk command can display the partitions and details like file system type. However it does not report the size of each partitions.
$ sudo fdisk -l

9. lsb_release
The lsb_release command prints out distribution specific information about a linux distro.
$ lsb_release -a

$ lsb_release -a || cat /etc/redhat-release || cat /etc/*-release || cat /etc/issue
If one option fails, the command moves to the next one, until one of them works. 
The above command is not a well tested one and is expected to work fine only on ubuntu/debian and centos/fedora based systems.


8.Run any one of the following command on Linux to see open ports:
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
sudo ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN
sudo lsof -i:22 ## see a specific port such as 22 ##
sudo nmap -sTU -O IP-address-Here
